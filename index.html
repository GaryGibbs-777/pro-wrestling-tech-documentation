            <p>Professional wrestling is is a type of athletic exhibition and entertainment involving wrestling matches
                whose progress and outcome are planned in advance, typically between performers with established
                character roles. The wrestling matches are based on classical and "catch" wrestling, with modern
                additions of striking attacks, acrobatics, feats of strength, fast-moving athleticism and occasionally,
                improvised weaponry. Professional wrestling also liberally incorporates melodrama. Much like some of the
                real prizefighters they imitate, the characters in professional wrestling have large egos, flamboyant
                personalities (often attached to a gimmick), and turbulent interpersonal relationships. These personas
                are scripted much like the matches. Performances mainly take place in a ring similar to the kind used in
                boxing. In televised wrestling shows, many additional "backstage" scenes are also recorded to supplement
                the drama in the ring.</p>

            <p>Professional wrestling in the United States and the United Kingdom began in the 19th century and early
                20th century as a genuine competitive sport based on Greco-Roman wrestling and later the more popular
                catch wrestling. Beginning in the early 1920s, wrestlers began choreographing some of their matches to
                make the matches less physically taxing, shorter in duration, and more entertaining. This allowed the
                wrestlers to perform more frequently and attract larger audiences. Authentic matches were still held
                into the 1930s but far less frequently. This business model was very successful and was imitated in
                other countries, with particular success in Mexico and Japan. Historically, professional wrestlers
                tended to have a strong background in amateur wrestling or catch wrestling, but this gradually faded
                over the years and promoters began attracting athletes from other sports. Modern day pro wrestlers do
                not necessarily need an amateur background to succeed in the sport. However, many pro wrestlers still
                consider a solid amateur background to be beneficial before embarking on a professional career.<br> <br>

                For a long time, those in the wrestling industry's insular community would not admit their "sport" was
                just theater, as the suspension of disbelief was thought to be crucial to the fun. Nowadays, the
                community is more open about it.</p>

                From the first established world championship, the top professional wrestlers have garnered fame within
                mainstream society. Each successive generation has produced a number of wrestlers who extend their
                careers into the realms of music, acting, writing, business, politics or public speaking, and are known
                to those who are unfamiliar with wrestling in general. Conversely, celebrities from other sports or
                general pop culture also become involved with wrestling for brief periods of time. A prime example of
                this is The Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection of the 1980s, which combined wrestling with MTV. <br><br>

                Some terminology originating in professional wrestling has found its way into the common vernacular.
                Phrases such as "body slam", "sleeper hold" and "tag team" are used by those who do not follow
                professional wrestling. The term "smackdown", popularized by The Rock and SmackDown! in the 1990s, has
                been included in Merriam-Webster dictionaries since 2007. <br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Many television shows and films have been produced which portray in-character professional wrestlers as
                protagonists, such as Ready to Rumble, ¡Mucha Lucha!, Nacho Libre, and the Santo film series. At least
                two stage plays set in the world of pro wrestling have been produced: The Baron is a comedy that retells
                the life of an actual performer known as Baron von Raschke. From Parts Unknown... is an award-nominated
                Canadian drama about the rise and fall of a fictional wrestler. The 2009 South Park episode "W.T.F."
                played on the soap operatic elements of professional wrestling. One of the lead characters on the Disney
                Channel series Kim Possible was a huge fan of pro wrestling and actually featured it on an episode (with
                two former WWE wrestlers voicing the two fictitious wrestlers featured in the episode). The 2008 film
                The Wrestler, about a washed-up professional wrestler, garnered several Oscar nominations. The 2017 TV
                series GLOW, based on the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling promotion, gained critical acclaim, including a
                nomination for Outstanding Comedy Series at the 70th Primetime Emmy Awards. <br>

                The 1950 film noir Night and the City, directed by Jules Dassin and starring Richard Widmark and Gene
                Tierney, told the story of a promoter in London trying to make it big, and featured a match involving
                real professional wrestler Stanislaus Zbyszko. Wrestling has also gained a major following on YouTube
                with WWE being the being the most subscribed wrestling channel and sixth most subscribed channel in the
                world. AEW also hosts its Dark and Elevation shows on YouTube.

                Historians are unsure at what point wrestling changed from competitive catch wrestling into worked
                entertainment. However, documented accounts do exist: WWE Superstar Bret "Hitman" Hart recalls "a long
                and fascinating talk" he had in the summer of 1981 with the great Lou Thesz who told him that:

                "the business was a total shoot until about 1925. At a time when Jack Dempsey was knocking everyone out
                in a couple of rounds and Babe Ruth was smashing the home run record in baseball, the average World
                Title (wrestling) match often lasted five or six hours and ended in a stalemate. Ed 'Strangler' Lewis,
                Thesz's mentor, was impossible to beat, so he eventually worked a title loss just to pump some new blood
                into the business and make a nice payoff—and that was when it had all changed." <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Those who participated felt that maintenance of a constant and complete illusion for all who were not
                involved was necessary to keep audience interest. For decades, wrestlers lived their public lives as
                though they were their characters. <br><br>

                The practice of keeping the illusion, and the various methods used to do so, came to be known as
                "kayfabe" within wrestling circles, or "working the marks". An entire lexicon of slang jargon and
                euphemism developed to allow performers to communicate without outsiders' knowledge of what was being
                said. <br><br>

                Occasionally a performer will deviate from the intended sequence of events. This is known as a shoot.
                Sometimes shoot-like elements are included in wrestling stories to blur the line between performance and
                reality. These are known as "worked shoots". However, the vast majority of events in professional
                wrestling are preplanned and improvised within accepted boundaries. <br><br>

                Gradually, the predetermined nature of professional wrestling became an open secret, as prominent
                figures in the wrestling business (including World Wrestling Entertainment owner Vince McMahon) began to
                publicly admit that wrestling was entertainment, not competition. This public reveal has garnered mixed
                reactions from the wrestling community, as some feel that exposure ruins the experience to the
                spectators as does exposure in illusionism. Despite the public admission of the theatrical nature of
                professional wrestling, many U.S. states still regulate professional wrestling as they do other
                professional competitive sports.For example, New York State still regulates "professional wrestling"
                through the New York State Athletic Commission (SAC). However, some states are considering removing, or
                have removed, professional wrestling from the purview of the state's athletic commissioners. <br><br>

                Matches are held between two or more sides ("corners"). Each corner may consist of one wrestler, or a
                team of two or more. Most team matches are governed by tag team rules (see below). Other matches are
                free-for-alls, with multiple combatants but no teams. In all variants, there can be only one winning
                team or wrestler.

                Matches are held within a wrestling ring, an elevated square canvas mat with posts on each corner. A
                cloth apron hangs over the edges of the ring. Three horizontal ropes or cables surround the ring,
                suspended with turnbuckles which are connected to the posts. For safety, the ropes are padded at the
                turnbuckles and cushioned mats surround the floor outside the ring. Guardrails or a similar barrier
                enclose this area from the audience. Wrestlers are generally expected to stay within the confines of the
                ring, though matches sometimes end up outside the ring, and even in the audience, to add excitement.</p>

            <p>The standard method of scoring is the "fall", which is accomplished by:

                Pinning the opponent's shoulders to the mat, typically for three seconds (though other times have been
                used):
                <ul>
                    <li>Forcing the opponent to submit</li>
                    <li>Disqualification of the opponent</li>
                    <li>The opponent remaining outside the ring for too long (countout)</li>
                    <li>Knocking out or otherwise incapacitating the opponent</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

                With its growing popularity, professional wrestling has attracted attention as a subject of serious
                academic study and journalistic criticism. Many courses, theses, essays and dissertations have analyzed
                wrestling's conventions, content, and its role in modern society. It is often included as part of
                studies on theatre, sociology, performance, and media. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology
                developed a course of study on the cultural significance of professional wrestling, and anthropologist
                Heather Levi has written an ethnography about the culture of lucha libre in Mexico. <br><br>

                This was not always the case. In the early 20th century, once it became apparent that the "sport" was
                worked, pro wrestling was looked down on as a cheap entertainment for the uneducated working class, an
                attitude that still exists to varying degrees today. The French theorist Roland Barthes was among the
                first to propose that wrestling was worthy of deeper analysis, in his essay "The World of Wrestling"
                from his book Mythologies, first published in 1957. Barthes argued that it should be looked at not as a
                scamming of the ignorant, but as spectacle; a mode of theatric performance for a willing, if
                bloodthirsty, audience. Wrestling is described as performed art which demands an immediate reading of
                the juxtaposed meanings. The logical conclusion is given least importance over the theatrical performers
                of the wrestlers and the referee. According to Barthes, the function of a wrestler is not to win: it is
                to go exactly through the motions which are expected of him and to give the audience a theatrical
                spectacle. This work is considered a foundation of all later study. <br><br>

                While pro wrestling is often described simplistically as a "soap opera for males", it has also been
                cited as filling the role of past forms of literature and theatre; a synthesis of classical heroics,
                commedia dell'arte, revenge tragedies, morality plays, and burlesque. The characters and storylines
                portrayed by a successful promotion are seen to reflect the current mood, attitudes, and concerns of
                that promotion's society and can in turn influence those same things. Wrestling's high levels of
                violence and masculinity make it a vicarious outlet for aggression during peacetime. <br>

            </p>
            <p>
                Documentary filmmakers have studied the lives of wrestlers and the effects the profession has on them
                and their families. The 1999 theatrical documentary Beyond the Mat focused on Terry Funk, a wrestler
                nearing retirement; Mick Foley, a wrestler within his prime; Jake Roberts, a former star fallen from
                grace; and a school of wrestling student trying to break into the business. The 2005 release Lipstick
                and Dynamite, Piss and Vinegar: The First Ladies of Wrestling chronicled the development of women's
                wrestling throughout the 20th century. Pro wrestling has been featured several times on HBO's Real
                Sports with Bryant Gumbel. MTV's documentary series True Life featured two episodes titled "I'm a
                Professional Wrestler" and "I Want to Be a Professional Wrestler." Other documentaries have been
                produced by The Learning Channel (The Secret World of Professional Wrestling) and A&E (Hitman Hart:
                Wrestling with Shadows). Bloodstained Memoirs explored the careers of several pro wrestlers, including
                Chris Jericho, Rob Van Dam and Roddy Piper.
